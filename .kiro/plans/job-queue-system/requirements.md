# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The A1C Estimator application needs a robust job queue system to handle background processing tasks asynchronously. This system will ensure that user-facing operations remain fast while computationally intensive tasks like A1C calculations, report generation, and notifications are processed in the background. The job queue will be implemented using Supabase for storage and processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a job queue table in the database, so that I can store and track background jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN the database SHALL have a job_queue table with appropriate columns
2. WHEN examining the job_queue table THEN it SHALL include columns for id, job_type, payload, status, created_at, updated_at, processed_at, and error
3. WHEN a new job is created THEN it SHALL be assigned a unique ID
4. WHEN a job is stored THEN its payload SHALL be stored as JSONB to allow flexible job parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define TypeScript interfaces for job types, so that I can ensure type safety when working with jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating job interfaces THEN the system SHALL have a base Job interface that all job types extend
2. WHEN defining job types THEN each job type SHALL have its own interface with appropriate payload structure
3. WHEN working with jobs in TypeScript THEN the compiler SHALL provide type checking for job properties
4. WHEN creating a new job THEN the system SHALL validate the job structure against its type definition

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create utility functions for job management, so that I can easily create, update, and process jobs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new job needs to be created THEN the system SHALL provide a function to insert it into the job_queue table
2. WHEN a job's status changes THEN the system SHALL provide a function to update its status
3. WHEN a job fails THEN the system SHALL record the error message
4. WHEN jobs need to be processed THEN the system SHALL provide a function to fetch pending jobs
5. WHEN a job is completed THEN the system SHALL update its status and processed_at timestamp

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement API endpoints for job management, so that the application can interact with the job queue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client needs to create a job THEN the API SHALL provide an endpoint to submit a new job
2. WHEN a client needs to check job status THEN the API SHALL provide an endpoint to retrieve job details
3. WHEN a client needs to list jobs THEN the API SHALL provide an endpoint with filtering and pagination
4. WHEN a job is submitted through the API THEN the system SHALL validate the request payload

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a job processor, so that jobs can be executed in the background.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are pending jobs THEN the processor SHALL pick them up in order of creation
2. WHEN processing a job THEN the processor SHALL update its status to "PROCESSING"
3. WHEN a job is completed successfully THEN the processor SHALL update its status to "COMPLETED"
4. WHEN a job fails THEN the processor SHALL update its status to "FAILED" and record the error
5. WHEN multiple jobs are pending THEN the processor SHALL handle them concurrently within configured limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement specific job handlers for A1C calculations, so that glucose readings can be processed asynchronously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new glucose reading is added THEN the system SHALL create a job to calculate A1C
2. WHEN processing an A1C calculation job THEN the system SHALL fetch the user's recent glucose readings
3. WHEN calculating A1C THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate algorithm
4. WHEN A1C calculation is complete THEN the system SHALL update the user's A1C estimates in the database

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement error handling and retry logic, so that transient failures don't cause permanent issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job fails THEN the system SHALL record the error details
2. WHEN a job fails due to a transient error THEN the system SHALL mark it for retry
3. WHEN retrying a job THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
4. WHEN a job fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL mark it as permanently failed
5. WHEN a job is permanently failed THEN the system SHALL provide a way to inspect and manually resolve it

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement monitoring and observability, so that I can track the health of the job queue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN jobs are processed THEN the system SHALL record metrics about processing time
2. WHEN the queue grows beyond a threshold THEN the system SHALL provide alerts
3. WHEN jobs fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN developers SHALL have access to queue depth, processing rate, and error rate metrics
