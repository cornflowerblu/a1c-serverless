# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement end-to-end testing for the critical user synchronization webhook that runs as a Supabase Edge Function. This webhook is responsible for keeping user data synchronized between Clerk (authentication provider) and our application database. Since this is a single point of failure in our system, comprehensive testing is essential to ensure reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tests for the user sync webhook so that I can be confident it correctly handles user creation, updates, and deletion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user is created in Clerk THEN the webhook SHALL create a corresponding user in our database
2. WHEN a user's information is updated in Clerk THEN the webhook SHALL update the corresponding user in our database
3. WHEN a user is deleted in Clerk THEN the webhook SHALL delete or deactivate the corresponding user in our database
4. WHEN the webhook receives malformed data THEN it SHALL handle the error gracefully and log appropriate information
5. WHEN the webhook operation fails THEN it SHALL retry the operation or log detailed error information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to run these tests in both development and CI environments so that I can catch issues before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests in a development environment THEN they SHALL use isolated test data that doesn't affect production
2. WHEN running tests in CI THEN they SHALL execute automatically and report results clearly
3. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear error messages that help identify the issue
4. WHEN webhook behavior changes THEN tests SHALL be easily updatable to reflect new requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want these tests to be comprehensive but maintainable so that they continue to provide value over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL focus on critical paths and edge cases
2. WHEN the webhook receives different types of Clerk events THEN tests SHALL verify correct handling of each event type
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL clean up after themselves to prevent test data accumulation
4. WHEN the webhook implementation changes THEN tests SHALL be modular enough to adapt without complete rewrites
