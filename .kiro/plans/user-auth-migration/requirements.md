# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the user management system from the current public.users table to the Supabase auth.users table. This migration is necessary to better integrate with Supabase's built-in authentication system, improve security, and streamline user management processes. The migration will involve changes to the database schema, API endpoints, and integration with the existing Clerk authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate user data from public.users to auth.users, so that we can leverage Supabase's built-in authentication system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration script runs THEN all existing user data SHALL be transferred from public.users to auth.users
2. WHEN the migration completes THEN user IDs, roles, and metadata SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the migration completes THEN all relationships to other tables SHALL remain intact
4. IF a user exists in both tables THEN the system SHALL merge the data appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all code references from public.users to auth.users, so that the application continues to function correctly after migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint accesses user data THEN it SHALL use auth.users instead of public.users
2. WHEN any database query references user data THEN it SHALL use auth.users instead of public.users
3. WHEN any TypeScript type definitions reference user data THEN they SHALL be updated to match the auth.users schema
4. WHEN the application runs after migration THEN all user-related functionality SHALL work as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the Clerk webhook integration to work with auth.users, so that user synchronization continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created in Clerk THEN the webhook SHALL create a corresponding entry in auth.users
2. WHEN a user is updated in Clerk THEN the webhook SHALL update the corresponding entry in auth.users
3. WHEN a user is deleted in Clerk THEN the webhook SHALL handle the deletion appropriately in auth.users
4. WHEN the webhook processes user events THEN it SHALL use the job queue system for reliability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update the authentication middleware to work with auth.users, so that user authentication and authorization continue to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the middleware SHALL verify credentials against auth.users
2. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the middleware SHALL use roles from auth.users
3. WHEN a user session is created THEN it SHALL include necessary data from auth.users
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all tests are updated to work with auth.users, so that we can verify the migration was successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN they SHALL use auth.users instead of public.users
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify user authentication works with auth.users
3. WHEN E2E tests run THEN they SHALL verify complete user flows with auth.users
4. WHEN tests create mock users THEN they SHALL create them in auth.users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a rollback plan in case of migration issues, so that we can restore the system to a working state if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration begins THEN the system SHALL create a backup of all user data
2. IF the migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. IF a rollback is needed THEN the rollback script SHALL restore the system to its previous state
4. WHEN the rollback completes THEN all user functionality SHALL work as before the migration attempt

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Supabase branching for the migration, so that we can safely develop and test the changes before applying them to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the migration THEN a new Supabase branch SHALL be created
2. WHEN developing the migration THEN all changes SHALL be made in the branch first
3. WHEN testing is complete THEN the branch SHALL be merged to production only after successful validation
4. IF issues are found THEN the branch SHALL be discarded without affecting production

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up database functions, policies, and triggers related to the clerk_id integration, so that we can simplify our database schema and improve maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all database functions specific to clerk_id handling SHALL be removed or updated
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all database policies that reference clerk_id SHALL be updated to use auth.users
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all database triggers related to user synchronization SHALL be updated or removed
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the database schema SHALL be simpler and more maintainable
