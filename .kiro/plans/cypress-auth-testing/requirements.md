# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The A1C Estimator application needs a reliable authentication mechanism for Cypress E2E tests. Currently, the application uses Clerk for authentication, but the E2E tests are experiencing issues where authentication is not properly working during test runs. The tests are redirecting to the Clerk authentication page instead of properly mocking the authentication process. This feature will implement a robust solution for handling authentication in Cypress tests to ensure reliable and consistent test execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to mock Clerk authentication in Cypress tests, so that I can test protected routes without real authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running Cypress tests THEN the system SHALL bypass the actual Clerk authentication flow
2. WHEN a test uses the authentication helper THEN the system SHALL simulate a logged-in user session
3. WHEN accessing protected routes in tests THEN the system SHALL NOT redirect to the Clerk login page
4. WHEN mocking authentication THEN the system SHALL support custom user properties for different test scenarios

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create reusable authentication commands in Cypress, so that I can easily authenticate in different test scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing E2E tests THEN developers SHALL have access to a simple command to authenticate
2. WHEN using the authentication command THEN it SHALL properly set all required cookies and local storage items
3. WHEN authenticated in tests THEN the middleware SHALL recognize the test user as authenticated
4. WHEN using the authentication command THEN it SHALL support different user roles and permissions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a test mode in the application middleware, so that it can detect and handle Cypress test authentication differently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in test mode THEN the middleware SHALL detect Cypress test authentication
2. WHEN middleware detects test authentication THEN it SHALL bypass the normal Clerk authentication flow
3. WHEN in test mode THEN the application SHALL accept the mock authentication credentials
4. WHEN implementing test mode THEN it SHALL NOT affect production authentication security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create test fixtures for authenticated API requests, so that I can test API endpoints that require authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN Cypress SHALL be able to make authenticated requests
2. WHEN intercepting API requests in tests THEN the system SHALL maintain the authentication context
3. WHEN using test fixtures THEN they SHALL include the necessary authentication headers
4. WHEN testing authenticated API endpoints THEN the tests SHALL NOT need to perform a real login flow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a consistent authentication state across page navigations in tests, so that the authentication persists throughout the test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages in tests THEN the authentication state SHALL persist
2. WHEN refreshing the page in tests THEN the user SHALL remain authenticated
3. WHEN running multiple tests THEN each test SHALL have its own isolated authentication state
4. WHEN a test completes THEN the authentication state SHALL be properly cleaned up
